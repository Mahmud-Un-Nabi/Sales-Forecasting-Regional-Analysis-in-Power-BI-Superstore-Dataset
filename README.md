# Sales Forecasting with Time Series Analysis in Power BI

This Power BI project is inspired from a youtube tutorial channel 'Rishabh Mishra' focuses on **sales forecasting and analysis** using a Superstore sales dataset across the **United States**. It provides a comprehensive overview of past sales trends, visual insights by region, and a forecast using time series techniques.

##  Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed historical sales data to identify trends, patterns, and key performance metrics. I built dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboards that allow users to explore:

- Total **Sales** and **Profit** by **State** and **City**
- Comparison between **Product Categories and Sub-Categories**
- **Time Series Forecast**
- **Map Visualizations** showing geographic performance of the superstore

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is based on **Superstore sales dataset**, commonly used in analytics portfolios.

---

## Insights Gained

- States like *California* and *New York* generate the highest sales and profit.
- Some regions show **high sales but low profit**, suggesting high costs or discounts.
- **Office Supply** category performs best across most cities.
- Sales forecast shows consistent growth pattern in the short term.

---

## Future Improvements

- Add seasonality components and compare year-over-year growth
- Integrate external datasets (e.g., economic indicators or weather)
- Use Python with Power BI for more advanced forecasting
